# Patient_monitoring_System_for_Ambulances_Group19
This is an IoT based real time patient monitoring device along with the ambulance location tracking system.

# PROBLEM
What can happen if ambulance arrives late at the emergency case ?

What can we do while Ambulance is carrying the Patient ?

No system for real-time patient monitoring and updating

No location tracking or time prediction system 

# EXISTING METHOD

Currently there are number of health monitoring systems available for ICU patients which can be used only when patient is on bed.

System is wired

Huge in size

Monitoring particular disease only

# PROPOSED METHOD

Data of patient health can be sent to a longer distance through the cloud

Find exact co-ordinates of ambulance using GPS

Fully automated system

Can take several measurements

# INTRODUCTION

Three main functions of the device 

1) Patient health monitoring 
2) Location tracking
3) Send real time data to the hospital
